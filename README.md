## Set up:
In the covid directory:
-Launch android studio and start emulator  
-`expo start`  
-`a`  for android emulator  


I have an iOS device and windows, so I will be using an android emulator


Step 2:  Go through REACT native Tutorial
Built Hello Applications
Run Hello applications on emulator and your phone.
It will be great to run it on two phones if you can (iOS and Android)

# Step 3:  Develop use case to display a map.  (GitHub location)

I have used react-native-maps to display a map on the app:


<img src=mapscreenshot.png width="40%">


Step 4:  On separate branch, exercise the CODVID-19 API (Documentation using postman) and display the data in your application as text.  Be fancy!  Style your results.
Step 5:  Overlay the data on the maps.
